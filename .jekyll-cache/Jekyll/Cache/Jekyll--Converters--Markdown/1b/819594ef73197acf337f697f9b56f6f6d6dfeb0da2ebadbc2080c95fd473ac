  <p>I am glad to announce that I have just joined the University of Virginia, USA, as a postdoctoral fellow. I am funded by the European Commission to work on the Marie Curie Postdoctoral fellowship <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101061853">(RISA-VLC)</a>. During the outgoing phase of the fellowship (Jan 23 ‚Äì Dec 24) I will be working at the University of Virginia (USA), and the return phase (Jan 25 - Dec 25) of the MSCA fellowship will be at the University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain). I will design RIS-based LiFi for enabling autonomous IoT devices, studying the boundaries on communication and energy harvesting. Keep posted on the results!</p>
